# Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning

Welcome! This repository is dedicated to exploring natural language processing (NLP) using deep learning techniques, providing a hands-on environment for learning and experimentation in this rapidly evolving field.

## Goals

The primary objective of this repository is to delve into NLP methods leveraging deep learning architectures. NLP, which focuses on enabling machines to understand and generate human language, is essential in domains such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, text generation, and chatbots. Mastering NLP with deep learning paves the way for breakthroughs in language modeling, question answering, named entity recognition, and much more.
